- As part of the development plan, a private branch will be created containing proprietary, non-open-source code,
including premium features and cryptographic key logic for SXBoard. While the core SXBoard project remains open source
under the BSD 3-Clause License, the private branch operates under a separate proprietary license and is classified as
the intellectual property of Ivan Koskov and [TSON]. This proprietary code is strictly
confidential, and any unauthorized access, use, or distribution is prohibited. The open-source license does not apply
to the private branch, which will be governed by its own license terms starting from the first public release of the
application.
